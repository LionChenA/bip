  bio: `I am a lifelong learner navigating the intersections of technology, culture, and humanity. My journey began in Chemistry, where I learned the rigor of scientific inquiry and the beauty of structural complexity. Today, I translate those analytical foundations into the realms of Media Ecology and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).`,
  philosophy: `I believe that technology should not just be a tool for efficiency, but a medium for human flourishing. I strive to build systems that are as thoughtful as they are functional, always prioritizing clarity, ethics, and the long-term impact on our digital environment.`,
